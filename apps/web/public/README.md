# Public Assets

Place static assets here that should be served directly.

## Logo File

**Please add your "PI" logo image file here as `logo.png`**

The logo file should be:
- Named exactly: `logo.png`
- PNG format (or you can use SVG as `logo.svg` and update the component)
- Transparent background preferred
- High resolution (at least 200px height for best quality)

Once you add the file, it will automatically appear in the sidebar.

If you're using a different filename or format, update `src/components/Logo.tsx` accordingly.
