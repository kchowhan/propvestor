## Logo File

Please add your "PI" logo image file as `logo.png` in this directory.

The logo should be:
- PNG format (or SVG)
- Transparent background preferred
- High resolution (at least 200px height for best quality)
- Named exactly `logo.png`

If you're using a different format (SVG, JPG, etc.), update the import in `src/components/Logo.tsx` accordingly.
