    <p>
      Landlord owns certain real property and improvements located at <strong>{{propertyAddress}}</strong> 
      (hereinafter referred to as the "Property"). The leased premises consist of <strong>{{propertyName}} - {{unitName}}</strong> 
      (hereinafter referred to as the "Premises"). Landlord desires to lease the Premises to Tenant upon the terms and 
      conditions contained herein. Tenant desires to lease the Premises from Landlord on the terms and conditions as contained herein.

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title"><span class="section-number">2. TERM.</span></div>
    <p>
      This Lease Agreement shall commence on <strong>{{date startDate}}</strong> and shall continue as a lease for term. 
      The termination date shall be on <strong>{{date endDate}}</strong> at 11:59 PM. Upon termination date, Tenant shall be 
      required to vacate the Premises unless one of the following circumstances occur:
    </p>
    <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <li>Landlord and Tenant formally extend this Lease Agreement in writing or create and execute a new, written, and signed Lease Agreement; or</li>
      <li>Landlord willingly accepts new Rent from Tenant, which does not constitute past due Rent.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the event that Landlord accepts new rent from Tenant after the termination date, a month-to-month tenancy shall be created. 
      If at any time either party desires to terminate the month-to-month tenancy, such party may do so by providing to the other party 
      written notice of intention to terminate at least 30 days prior to the desired date of termination of the month-to-month tenancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notices to terminate may be given on any calendar day, irrespective of Commencement Date. Rent shall continue at the rate specified 
      in this Lease Agreement, or as allowed by law. All other terms and conditions as outlined in this Lease Agreement shall remain in 
      full force and effect. Time is of the essence for providing notice of termination (strict compliance with dates by which notice must 
      be provided is required).

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title"><span class="section-number">3. RENT.</span></div>
    <p>
      Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sum of <strong>{{currency rentAmount}}</strong> per month as Rent for the Term of the Agreement. 
      Due date for Rent payment shall be the <strong>{{rentDueDay}}</strong> day of each calendar month and shall be considered advance 
      payment for that month. Weekends and holidays do not delay or excuse Tenant's obligation to timely pay rent.

    <div class="clause">
      <div class="clause-title">A. Delinquent Rent.</div>
      <p>

        day of each calendar month. If Tenant fails to timely pay any month's rent, Tenant will pay Landlord a late charge as allowed by law 
        until rent is paid in full. Any waiver of late charges under this paragraph will not affect or diminish any other right or remedy 
        Landlord may exercise for Tenant's failure to timely pay rent.

    <div class="clause">
      <div class="clause-title">B. Prorated Rent.</div>
      <p>
        In the event that the Commencement Date is not the {{rentDueDay}} of the calendar month, Rent payment remitted on the Commencement Date 
        shall be prorated based on a 30-day period.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="clause">
      <div class="clause-title">C. Returned Checks.</div>

        Landlord a fee as allowed by law for each such check, plus late charges, as described above, until Landlord has received payment. 
        Furthermore, Landlord may require in writing that Tenant pay all future Rent payments by cash, money order, or cashier's check.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="clause">
      <div class="clause-title">D. Order in which funds are applied.</div>

        Landlord will apply all funds received from Tenant first to any non-rent obligations of Tenant including late charges, returned check 
        charges, charge-backs for repairs, brokerage fees, and periodic utilities, then to rent, regardless of any notations on a check.
      </p>

    <div class="clause">
      <div class="clause-title">E. Rent Increases.</div>
